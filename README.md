# Prison Escape Game

This is a 2D 'prison escape' game in Python, utilizing the pygame library. 

Players can navigate their character around a grid map of blocks using the arrow keys on their keyboard. 
The character is initially placed at a starting point, and the map contains moving guards. 
The aim is to reach the exit point while avoiding all the guards, to successfully ‘escape the prison’.

Just a beginner's attempt at a basic grid-based game. Have fun!
