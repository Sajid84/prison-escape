# Prison Escape Game

This is a 2D 'prison escape' game in Python, utilizing the pygame library. 

Players can navigate their character around a grid map of blocks using the arrow keys on their keyboard. 
The character is initially placed at a starting point, and the map contains moving guards. 
The aim is to reach the exit point while avoiding all the guards, to successfully ‘escape the prison’.

Just a beginner's attempt at a basic grid-based game. Have fun!

1. download all the files to your computer
2. install pygame and numpy package

4. use arrow keys to navigate the player around the guards
5. reach the blue block at the top-right to escape!
